A sophisticated R package for calculating rolling R-squared values across multiple companies using panel data analysis with object-oriented programming.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced analytical framework to compute **coefficient of determination (R-squared)** for corporate financial data using **8-year rolling windows**. The analysis measures how well economic indicators explain variations in company performance over time.

### Key Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design** using R6 classes for modular, maintainable code
- **Rolling Window Analysis** with configurable time periods
- **Multi-Company Processing** handles panel data efficiently
- **Professional Visualization** with ggplot2 graphics
- **Robust Error Handling** for real-world data quality issues

🚀 Quick Start
Installation & Setup


# Install required packages
install.packages(c("R6", "readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "purrr"))

# Run the analysis
source("scripts/panel_analysis.R")
analyzer <- PanelAnalyzerR6$new("data/panel_data.xlsx")
analyzer$run_analysis(window_size = 8)

Basic Usage


# Create analyzer instance
analyzer <- PanelAnalyzerR6$new("data/panel_data.xlsx", 1)

# Execute analysis
analyzer$run_analysis(window_size = 8)

# Get results
summary_stats <- analyzer$get_summary()
results_df <- analyzer$get_results()

# Generate visualizations
analyzer$plot_results()
